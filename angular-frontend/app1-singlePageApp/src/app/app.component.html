<app-user></app-user>

<!-- <app-user> is a custom HTML element defined in the Angular application and corresponds to the UserComponent class. When this element is included in an HTML template, Angular replaces it with the contents of the component's template. So, this code snippet is essentially including the UserComponent in the HTML page and displaying its content below the heading. -->
