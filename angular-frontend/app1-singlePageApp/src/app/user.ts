// The User class is a TypeScript class that represents a user in an application. The class has four properties:

// id: The id of the user.
// firstName: The first name of the user.
// lastName: The last name of the user.
// email: The email address of the user.
// The properties are declared with the exclamation mark (!) to indicate that they are required. This means that the user must provide a value for each property when creating a new user.
